## Installation
For manual installation, go to  **your themes folder, open a command prompt / powershell / terminal / or git bash**  and enter the following:
```
git clone https://github.com/LuckFire/BottomBarRevert
```

For quick installation (not recommended), go to  **Settings -> Themes -> Quick CSS**  and copy-paste the following code:
```css
@import url("https://raw.githack.com/LuckFire/BottomBarRevert/master/bottombar.css")

:root {
      --bar-color: var(--background-tertiary) !important /* Changes the bar color. */
}
```

## Credits 
Thank you to Hoofer for helping me get the bottom area below the members list colored as well as finding multiple issues because I am super stupid.
